// `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` are relative symlinks so every agent reads one set of
// instructions. Two things stop them from simply being committed and left alone:
//
//   - `vp create github:<repo>` extracts with degit, which rewrites a relative symlink into an
//     absolute path inside its own cache — then deletes that cache, leaving the link dangling.
//     "Download ZIP" drops symlinks entirely. `git clone` preserves them.
//   - `vp create` writes agent instruction files itself, and does it *before* installing. It
//     will not write around a `CLAUDE.md` that already exists: it dies with EEXIST when it
//     wants to create the symlink, or ENOENT when the one it finds is degit-broken. So
//     `CLAUDE.md` is gitignored, and this script is what puts it there.
//
// Running from `prepare` makes every generation path converge on the same two links, whether
// `vp create` made them, degit broke them, or nothing created them at all. This never replaces
// a real file or directory: a repo that deliberately keeps its own `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/` is
// left alone and told so. Failure to link is reported, never thrown — a missing symlink is
// worth a warning, not a failed install.
